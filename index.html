        <h4>Mr.Bean</h4>
            <p>The childish Mr Bean uses his unusual wit to fulfil everyday tasks. But more often than not, he ends up creating trouble for himself and those around him.</p>

            <h4>POKEMON</h4>
            <p>It is my favourite cartoon, as it is entertaining and also teaches values like friendship, team work, courage, love, etc.</p>
